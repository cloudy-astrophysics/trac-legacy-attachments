stop zone 1
title Leiden meeting model 5
c This is one of the tests in Rollig et al. 2007, A&A, 467, 187 
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
c Use the Draine 1978 field, for a semi-infinite slab we have to use half
c the requested value, so the actual value
c is half the requested value
c they want for the model is actually twice the value below
c table draine 5.5
c Quan: use grid command to vary incident intensity
table draine 4.7 vary
c grid, from -0.5 to 6.5 in 0.1 dex steps
grid, from 4.7 to 4.801 in 0.1 dex steps
extinguish 24
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
c  hydrogen density 
c Quan: use grid command to vary hden from 1 to 6.5
hden 5.4
c hden 5.2 vary
c grid, from 1 to 7 in 0.1 dex steps
c grid, from 5.2 to 5.3 in 0.1 dex steps
grains ism 1.16 no qheat
c  add PAHs 
grains PAH no qheat 3 function
c
c commands controlling geometry  =========
c
c other commands for details     =========
failures 3
c  use leiden initialization file
init file="pdr_leiden.ini"
c
c commands controlling output    =========
print line faint off
c print last iteration
